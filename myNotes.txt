Short - circuit evaluation eg with ||

let a; 
undefined (falsy value)

let b = null; 
null (falsy value)

let c = undefined;
undefined (falsy value)

let d = 4; 
number (truthy value) 

let e = "five";
short circuits before reaching here
since (d = 4) evaluates to truth.

let f = a || b || c || d || e;
console.log(f); 4

|| checks for one truth to pass the whole condition
